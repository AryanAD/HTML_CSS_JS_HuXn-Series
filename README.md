# HTML_CSS_JS_HuXn-Series

## What is this?

- This repo is me following 'HuXn WebDev' from YouTube on his journey to complete 100+ projects on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

- Currently, I am a beginner in web development. So, I have picked this project as a practice series in order to improve my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

- I will be working with Git and GitHub during this process and I will try to be as consistent as possible.

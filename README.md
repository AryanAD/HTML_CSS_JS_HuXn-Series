> As this repo started getting popular recently, I decided to add this note here.<br>
<b>NOTE: This repo does not and will not contain all the 100 projects because I stopped doing vanilla HTML, CSS and JS when I felt confident enough and switched to React and other technologies.</b>
# HTML_CSS_JS_HuXn-Series

## What is this?

- This repo is me following 'HuXn WebDev' from YouTube on his journey to complete 100+ projects on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

- Currently, I am a beginner in web development. So, I have picked this project as a practice series in order to improve my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

- I will be working with Git and GitHub during this process and I will try to be as consistent as possible.

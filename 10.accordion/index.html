                The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be
                displayed in a web
                browser. It defines the meaning and structure of web content. It is often assisted by technologies such
                as Cascading
                Style Sheets and scripting languages such as JavaScript.

                Cascading Style Sheets is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document
                written in a markup
                language such as HTML or XML. CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and
                JavaScript.

                JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that is one of the core technologies of
                the World Wide
                Web, alongside HTML and CSS. As of 2023, 98.7% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage
                behavior, often
                incorporating third-party libraries.

                React is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces based on
                components. It is
                maintained by Meta and a community of individual developers and companies. React can be used to develop
                single-page,
                mobile, or server-rendered applications with frameworks like Next.js.

                Node.js is a cross-platform, open-source server environment that can run on Windows, Linux, Unix, macOS,
                and more.
                Node.js is a back-end JavaScript runtime environment, runs on the V8 JavaScript engine, and executes
                JavaScript code
                outside a web browser.
